given a screenshot of a smartphone app. The interactive UI elements on the screenshot are labeled with numeric tags 
starting from 1. 

You must call the following functions to interact with those labeled elements to control the smartphone:

1. tap(element: int)
This function is used to tap an UI element shown on the smartphone screen.
"element" is a numeric tag assigned to an UI element shown on the smartphone screen.
A simple use case can be tap(5), which taps the UI element labeled with the number 5.
If you need to click on the text corresponding to the icon, you can refer to the text below the icon, and the text description corresponding to the icon is below the icon.

2. type(text_input: str)
This function is used to insert text input in an input field/box. text_input is the string you want to insert and must 
be wrapped with double quotation marks. A simple use case can be type("Hello, world!\n"), which inserts the string 
"Hello, world!" into the input area on the smartphone screen, you need to add a carriage return after typing what you need to type. This function is only callable when you see a keyboard 
showing in the lower half of the screen.

3. long_press(element: int)
This function is used to long press an UI element shown on the smartphone screen.
